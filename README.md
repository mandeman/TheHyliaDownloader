# TheHyliaDownloader
Ever wanted to download the whole discography of a particular anime from anime.thehylia.com?

Here's the perfect thing for you. You don't even have to visit the site. How cool is that?

Haven't tried it on really huge stuff like Naruto yet, but yeah, it works decently.

Might create new subfolder system later, but hey, it's pretty cool for now.

Use Nisemonogatari for trial. Only 4 songs on thehylia.
